#Create an application to load student data from a CSV file into a database. Each row should contain student details such as name, age, class, address_street, address_city, address_state, address_zipcode, hobby1, hobby2, and hobby3. Please ensure to create three tables for storing the userâ€™s basic information, address, and hobby; they should be appropriately connected with foreign keys. The data should be listed, and it should be editable as well.
